# Basic-Implementations-in-FPGA
Basic Implementations in FPGA using Verilog. These codes were part of the "FPGA Programming" Lab, in Informatik Department of KIT.
For simulation I use the Quartus II and the parameters of the FPGA were the following: 
Device family -> Cyclone IV E 
Device -> EP4CE115F29C7
